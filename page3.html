 What is Computer Security?<br>
 </h3>
 <h3> 
The meaning of the term computer security has evolved in recent years. Before the problem of data security became widely publicized in the media, most people's idea of computer security focused on the physical machine. Traditionally, computer facilities have been physically protected for three reasons<br>
</h3>
<h3>
*To prevent theft of or damage to the hardware<br>
*To prevent theft of or damage to the information <br>
*To prevent disruption of service <br>
</h3>
<h3>
Strict procedures for access to the machine room are used by most organizations, and these procedures are often an organization's only obvious computer security measures. Today, however, with pervasive remote terminal access, communications, and networking, physical measures rarely provide meaningful protection for either the information or the service; only the hardware is secure. Nonetheless, most computer facilities continue to protect their physical machine far better than they do their data, even when the value of the data is several times greater than the value of the hardware.<br>

 <h3>
You probably are not reading this book to learn how to padlock your PC. Information security is the subject of this book. Furthermore, we are limiting our study to the insider problem: the security violations perpetrated (perhaps inadvertently) by legitimate users whom padlocks and passwords cannot deter. Most computer crimes are in fact committed by insiders, and most of the research in computer security since 1970 has been directed at the insider problem.
